# Ao v24  
### Personal-scale Cognitive Architecture (Research Prototype)

Ao v24 is a **conceptual and partially implemented cognitive architecture**
designed to explore **visible internal state, structural constraints,
and irreversible abstraction**.

This repository represents a **public reference version** intended for
reading, inspection, and research discussion.

Ao is **not** a task-optimized AI, LLM replacement, or commercial product.
It is a **structural experiment** focused on how cognition can be made
explicit, constrained, and observable.

---

## Project Positioning

Ao is released in multiple stages:

- **Ao v24 (this repository)**  
  → Open reference version (concepts, partial implementation, research notes)

- **Ao v25 (Executable Prototype)**  
  → Runnable reference implementation for observation and experimentation  
  → Available on DLsite:  
  https://www.dlsite.com/home/work/=/product_id/RJ01533347.html

- **Ao v26 (Code Edition / Research Build)**  
  → Extended, fully structured research-oriented implementation  
  → (Link will be added here upon release)

Ao v24 exists to **establish design lineage and conceptual grounding**.
Later versions focus on **execution, experimentation, and research use**.

---

## Design Philosophy

Ao explores an alternative direction to modern AI systems:

- Internal states are **explicit and inspectable**
- Cognitive processes are **structurally constrained**
- Memory growth induces **compression pressure**
- Abstraction is treated as **irreversible**
- The user interface is considered part of the cognitive structure

The goal is not performance, but **interpretability and structural clarity**.

---

## Architecture Overview (Conceptual)

Ao is designed around the following ideas:

- Explicit internal state variables
- Capacity-limited memory layers
- Compression-driven abstraction
- Narrative and conceptual consolidation
- Multi-axis world-model framing (e.g. causality, boundary, self-reference)

⚠️ **Important:**  
Not all described components are fully implemented in v24.
This repository represents a **design reference and partial prototype**.

## Implementation Status (v24)

| Component                              | Status | Notes |
|----------------------------------------|--------|------|
| Core agent structure                   | ✅     | Basic operation |
| Internal state representation          | ✅     | Logged / inspectable |
| Memory handling                        | ⚠️     | Partial / experimental |
| Compression mechanisms                 | ⚠️     | Prototype level |
| Irreversible abstraction               | ❌     | Conceptual only |
| Emotion / modulation systems           | ❌     | Not implemented |
| Full world-model axis integration      | ❌     | Design-stage |

Ao v24 should be understood as a **structural sketch with executable elements**,
not a finished system.

---

## Intended Use

Ao v24 is intended for:

- Cognitive architecture research
- Conceptual exploration
- Educational inspection
- Design discussion and critique

It is **not intended** for production use or performance benchmarking.

## Citation & Reference Use

If referencing Ao in academic or technical writing, the following format
is recommended:

> Ao v24 (Maou-kun, 2025),  
> personal-scale cognitive architecture research prototype.

Ao may be cited as an **experimental cognitive scaffold** or
**structural research instrument**, not as a benchmark AI system.

## Notes

Ao is intentionally released in an incomplete and inspectable form.
This is a design choice, not a limitation.

Understanding Ao requires reading structure, not expecting utility.
